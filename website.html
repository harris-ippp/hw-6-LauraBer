<h1>The Syrian <em>Refugee Crisis</em></h1>

Syria is suffering an armed conflict since five years. What began as another Arab Spring uprising with anti-government protests has escalated into a full-scale civil war, drawing in regional and world powers. The actors are as follows:
<p> ●	forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, including the President’s Shia Alawite sect, Lebanon’s Shia Islamist Hezbollah movement, as well as increased financial and military assistance out of Iran and Russia.
<P> ●	forces opposed to President Assad, including the country’s Sunni majority, as well as international support from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, the US, the UK and France.
<p> ●	Jihadist militants from the so-called Islamic State (IS).
<p> The conflict continues to evolve, with Islamists and Jihadists now outnumbering secular moderates. In addition, the fighting has developed into a “war within a war”, where actors are engaging rival jihadists from the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra front, in addition to rebels, government forces and Kurdish fighters. The political arena has also deteriorated as rival alliances battle for supremacy.
Millions of people have fled the war zone.

<p>

Dealing with a sharp increase of migration became a serious <em>challenge</em> for many countries over the past 5 years.

<p>

The <em>top five countries</em> offering refuge to Syrian refugees are:

<table>
  <tr><th>Guest Country</th>        <th>Number of Refugees</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Turkey</td>       <td>2.5 million</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Lebanon</td>     <td>1.1 million</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Jordan</td>  <td>636,000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Iraq</td>      <td>245,100</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Egypt</td> <td>118,000</td></tr>
</table>

  <h2 id="C1">Refugees</h2>
  <p>
  We call migrants refugees when living conditions force them to leave their country against their wish to stay.
  <p>
  <b>Main causes for refugees to leave their country are:</b>
  <p>
  1. Political or ethnic persecution: security threats due to political or ethnic affiliation
  <p>
  2. Active war: threat of live
  <p>
  3. Humanitarian crisis: lack of food, education and health service

  <p>

  <b>International Organizations providing information about the Syrian refugees:</b>
